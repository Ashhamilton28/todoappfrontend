## Unsolved Problems
None. I'm happy it works!

## Future Enhancements
Future enhancements that I would like to implement in my app is for my To-Do app to be able to create to do lists based on the day, week and month and for my app to give users reminders of what they have to do.
I would also like to add a feature where users can upload their own pictures to use/change their backgrounds,  different fonts, icons and text colors.
